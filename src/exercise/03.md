# useContext: simple Counter

## üìù Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/03.md`

Use useContext sparingly. This allows you to share state between components as
long as the components are children of the relevant contextProvider. This is
good because it allows state to be shared only between the children (without
prop drilling, which is the main benefit) that need it, making the app easier to
maintain.

Prop drilling is bad because you have to pass the state down mulitple children
that dont need it to get to the child that actually needs it.

However, the issue with useContext is that the state is IMPLIED. Which means
that the user of our components cant see all the dependencies of that state
without opening the file. For example, `<Component foo={'bar'} />` the user may
think foo is the only dependency and if they use the component outside the scope
of `<ContextProvider>`, they wont have access to the state from `useContext`,
leading to undesired behaviour.

The alternative to implied state is Component Composition, which makes all the
deps. of the component explicit.

When `useContext` is used, make sure to use it via a `useContextHook` that
checks to make sure that the consumer of the state is trying to access the state
within the ProviderContext

## Background

Sharing state between components is a common problem. The best solution for this
is to üìú [lift your state](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html). This
requires üìú [prop drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling) which is
not a problem, but there are some times where prop drilling can cause a real
pain.

To avoid this pain, we can insert some state into a section of our react tree,
and then extract that state anywhere within that react tree without having to
explicitly pass it everywhere. This feature is called `context`. In some ways
it's like global variables, but it doesn't suffer from the same problems (and
maintainability nightmares) of global variables thanks to how the API works to
make the relationships explicit.

Here's how you use context:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'

const FooContext = React.createContext()

function FooDisplay() {
  const foo = React.useContext(FooContext)
  return <div>Foo is: {foo}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <FooContext.Provider value="I am foo">
    <FooDisplay />
  </FooContext.Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
// renders <div>Foo is: I am foo</div>
```

`<FooDisplay />` could appear anywhere in the render tree, and it will have
access to the `value` which is passed by the `FooContext.Provider` component.

Note that as a first argument to `createContext`, you can provide a default
value which React will use in the event someone calls `useContext` with your
context, when no value has been provided:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<FooDisplay />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

Most of the time, I don't recommend using a default value because it's probably
a mistake to try and use context outside a provider, so in our exercise I'll
show you how to avoid that from happening.

ü¶â Keep in mind that while context makes sharing state easy, it's not the only
solution to Prop Drilling pains and it's not necessarily the best solution
either. React's composition model is powerful and can be used to avoid issues
with prop drilling as well. Learn more about this from

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/exercise/03.js)
- [Final](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/03.js)

We're putting everything in one file to keep things simple, but I've labeled
things a bit so you know that typically your context provider will be placed in
a different file and expose the provider component itself as well as the custom
hook to access the context value.

We're going to take the Count component that we had before and separate the
button from the count display. We need to access both the `count` state as well
as the `setCount` updater in these different components which live in different
parts of the tree. Normally lifting state up would be the way to solve this
trivial problem, but this is a contrived example so you can focus on learning
how to use context.

Your job is to fill in the `CountProvider` function component so that the app
works and the tests pass.

## Extra Credit

### 1. üíØ create a consumer hook

[Production deploy](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/03.extra-1.js)

Imagine what would happen if someone tried to consume your context value without
using your context provider. For example, as mentioned above when discussing the
default value:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<FooDisplay />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

If you don't provide a default context value, that would render
`<div>Foo is: </div>`. This is because the context value would be `undefined`.
In real-world scenarios, having an unexpected `undefined` value can result in
errors that can be difficult to debug.

In this extra credit, you need to create a custom hook that I can use like this:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useCount()
```

And if you change the `App` to this:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CountDisplay />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}
```

It should throw an error indicating that `useCount` must be used within a
CountProvider.

### 2. üíØ caching in a context provider

[Production deploy](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/03.extra-2.js)

Let's try the last exercise over again with a bit more of a complex/practical
example. That's right! We're back to the Pokemon info app! This time it has
caching in place which is cool. So if you enter the same pokemon information,
it's cached so it loads instantaneously.

However, we have a requirement that we want to list all the cached pokemon in
another part of the app, so we're going to use context to store the cache. This
way both parts of the app which need access to the pokemon cache will have
access.

Because this is hard to describe in words (and because it's a completely
separate example), there's a starting point for you in
`./src/exercise/03.extra-2.js`.

## ü¶â Other notes

`Context` also has the unique ability to be scoped to a specific section of the
React component tree. A common mistake of context (and generally any
"application" state) is to make it globally available anywhere in your
application when it's actually only needed to be available in a part of the app
(like a single page). Keeping a context value scoped to the area that needs it
most has improved performance and maintainability characteristics.
